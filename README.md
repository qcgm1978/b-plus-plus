        *.  empty and name

                  * change as presentation: ui CSS 3 will and presentation 
	          * laying all over the language

		              	* utility : google web designer
	                *micro : code interface - core, test(runtime testing), ui, comments, doc etc like jsbin's interface. so I can fork jsbin and convert it into the editor of b++
	
           "The usefulness of a pot comes from its emptiness."-laozi . relevant to creating patterns
        

	* tool The workbench becomes the center of the wood shop, the craftsman returning to it time and time again as a piece takes shape.For a programmer manipulating files of text, that workbench is the command shell.(the pragmatic programmer, shell games section)

        * the first and only principle : dry.  apply it quite broadly to include "database schemas, test plans, the build system, even documentation."(pragmatic programmer)
		* ipad
		* language 

			* fc

				* formal markdown idea plain text: And we believe that the best format for storing knowledge persistently is plain text.

			* language The limits of language are the limits of one's world. Ludwig Von Wittgenstein
				* Language Implementation Patterns

					* There are four common kinds of scoping rules: languages with a single scope, nested scopes, C-style struct scopes, and class scopes

				* minimalism(Minimalism (visual arts))
					*  set out to expose the essence, essentials or identity of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms, features or concepts. 

				* loop
					* At the level of machine or assembly language, control flow instructions usually work by altering the program counter. For some CPUs the only control flow instructions available are conditional or unconditional branch instructions (also called jumps).
