Names have to reflect what a variable, field, property stands for. Names have to be precise.
Choose Names at Appropriate Level of Abstraction +
Choose names that reflect the level of abstraction of the class or method you are working in.
Name Interfaces After Functionality They Abstract +
The name of an interface should be derived from its usage by the client, such as IStream.
Name Classes After How They Implement Their Interfaces + The name of a class should reflect how it fulfils the functionality provided by
its interface(s), such as MemoryStream : IStream
Name Methods After What They Do +
The name of a method should describe what is done, not how it is done.
Use Long Names for Long Scopes +
fieldsparameterslocalsloop variables long short
Names Describe Side Effects +
Names have to reflect the entire functionality.
Standard Nomenclature Where Possible +
Don’t invent your own language when there is a standard.
Encodings in Names –
No prefixes, no type/scope information
